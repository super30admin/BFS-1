# Solution

# // Time Complexity : BFS - O(N) since we go through each node
#                      DFS - O(N) since we go through each node
# // Space Complexity : BFS - O(N/2) since at any point of time max size of queue will be the breadth of binary tree and
#                       max breadth of binary tree will be at leaf nodes and max breadth will be N/2
#                       DFS - O(N), it is actually O(H), H is height of binary tree but worst case height will be N
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Approach1 is BFS, we can use a queue to hold the child nodes and then update the current level nodes into a list. Once all
# current level nodes are added in temp list, we can add that list to result. While checking each current level nodes from queue
# we can append child nodes of that node into queue so that those can be processed in next iteration
# Approach2 is DFS, we can keep an empty list as result. Use recursion to go into left and right nodes of each node. As it navigates
# to next level left node, check if list size and level number is same. If same then a list for that level is not in the result list
# so we will add that level list to result list. Now if we go back to previous node and then navigate to the right of the node
# we can see that level is smaller than size of list, so a list already exists in result for that level. So we can access that
# level list using level as the index and add the new element(right element of node) to existing list.
