# Solution

# // Time Complexity : O(V+E) even in check cycle approach, since we do not process the same vertex again once it is marked in DP
#                      Incase DP is not maintained, then it will be V^V
#                      O(V+E) since we will be removing all the edges one by one to see if all the edges can be removed and
#                      since we do it by going for each vertex once, so we need to include vertex count as well.
# // Space Complexity : O(V) since we keep an array for all the vertices to mark in path and an array for all vertices for DP
#                       O(2V+2E), since dictionary will have all the edges and vertices, indegree will have size equal to number
#                       of vertices and queue size can go upto numbmer of edges in worst case scenario
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Check Cycle Approach: We can keep array to make a note of visited nodes in each cycle and one array to keep overall if we have
# reached node which does not have any other edge to be processed. Based on these two, we can decide if there is a cycle or not
# by checking if any vertex already has marked "True" when we are going to that vertex as we are performing DFS
# Approach is to come up with indegree for all the courses. If as we take courses, indegrees of all courses reduce to zero
# that means we can take all courses. Create a list to hold indegree of each course. Create a adjacency list(using dictionary) for the map/graph which
# keeps track of all the destinations node for each source node, with source node as key of dictonary
# Once these are done, we can find all the vertices with 0 in degree and reduce indegree by one for all the vertices to which 
# current vertex was connected. If any connected vertices's in degree becomes 0, add that to the same queue and further reduce
# indegree for all the connected nodes. Keep a counter to check the number of nodes getting added to queue. If the count is same
# as numCourses once the iteration is done then we can take all courses and we can return True
