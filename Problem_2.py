BFS 

1) Based on the adjacency list of the edges, created a dictionary with key as course and value as list of prereq's to be 
  completed to finish the course - which is key.
  
2) Created a list named courses which stores value 'a' at i th position where i is the vertice and a is the number of courses
   for which i is prereq.
   
3) Start a queue with all i's with courses[i] as 0.

4) While iterating theorugh the queue, retreive the queue elements value form dictionary and decrease count of courses[i] by 1.

5) Add all the courses[i] which become 0 to the queue.
