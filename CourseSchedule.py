# Time Complexity : O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
# Space Complexity : 
#   O(V) worst case a recursion could explore all nodes and the stack will hold them all. 
#   Hence, stack, visited, and checked have O(3V) = O(V) where V is the number of vertices or numCourses.

''' The problem reduces to checking if there is a cycle per DFS path.
    Hence, the visited set takes a sort of back tracking approach.
    The checked set is to avoid recomputation of already validated nodes, i.e., 
    if we know that there is no cycle starting from this node we can return True. 
    Kind of like memoization from Recurisve Dynamic Programming.
